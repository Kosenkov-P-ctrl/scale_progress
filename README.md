## who is the project for?

- The need for this project came to me because of a person who said that in order to become a professional in any field, you need to do this business for 10,000 hours.
- For me :) because I want to become a professional in programming
- And for everyone who wants to help me in the difficult path of becoming \ or also help yourself
